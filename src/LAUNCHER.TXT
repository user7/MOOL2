    1. Overview

Launcher is a GUI program for installing, configuring and running
unofficial fan patch 1.50 for Master of Orion 2. Since 1.50.8 the
patch supports improved mod format which allows Launcher to detect
installed mods and present available options to user. Launcher also
exposes few DOSBox options, in particular network multiplayer is now
trivial to setup. In launch window right-clicking any mod or option
brings up its discription.

Launcher package normally includes the latest 1.50 patch package under
MOO2.1.50.* subdirectory, so you don't need to download it separately.

You MUST OWN a copy of Master of Orion 2, to install or run the patch.
This package does not contain original game files.


    2. System requirements

Launcher works on Windows (XP through 10), GNU/Linux (tested on
Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian), Mac OS X. Other Unix-like systems with
recent enough Tk should be capable of running it.
