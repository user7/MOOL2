    1. Overview

MOO2 Launcher is a GUI program for installing, configuring and running
unofficial fan patch 1.50 for Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares.
Since 1.50.8 the patch supports an improved mod format which allows
MOO2 Launcher to detect installed mods and present the available
options to the user. MOO2 Launcher also exposes a few DOSBox options,
in particular network multiplayer is now trivial to setup. In launch
window, right-clicking any mod or option brings up its discription.

MOO2 Launcher package includes the latest 1.50 patch package under
patch/ subdirectory, so there is no need to download it separately.

You MUST OWN a copy of Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares, to
install or run the patch. The MOO2 Launcher package does not contain
original game files.


    2. System requirements

MOO2 Launcher works on Windows (XP through 10), GNU/Linux (tested on
Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian), Mac OS X. Other Unix-like systems with
recent enough Tk should be capable of running it.
