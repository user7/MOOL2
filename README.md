MOO2 Launcher
=============

Is a Tk GUI for installing and running unofficial fan
[patch 1.50](http://moo2mod.com) for **Master of Orion 2**.
While you can install and run the patch manually, using Launcher has some perks:

- Installator checks whether your copy of the game is recent enough.
- Installator auto-detects game path for Steam or GOG package.
- It's easy to configure DOSBox, in particular to setup network multiplayer.
- It's easy to change enabled mods, no need to edit configs.
- Quick access to build lists and scripts.
- All documentation and links available in help menu.

System requirements
-------------------

Windows XP through 10 are supported, older versions are not.

Launcher is likely to work on any recent GNU/Linux distro, at least Ubuntu and
Fedora were tested. In fact any Unix-like system with fresh enough Tk toolkit
should be capable of running it.
