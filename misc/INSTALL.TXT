
                  MOO2 Launcher and patch 1.50.x


MOO2 Launcher is a program that can install, configure and run MOO2
1.50 patch. You need a working copy of MOO2 1.31+ to install it.

Installation:

Note that installation doesn't damage your distribution, the 1.50 executable is
installed alongside the old one. To run your old version (e.g. GOG) use your
old shortcut and to run 1.50 use the Launcher.

1. Unzip package anywhere. On Windows run MOO2 Launcher.exe. On Linux open a
   terminal inside unzipped directory and run ./moo2-launcher. On Mac OS X
   right click moo2-launcher and choose open.

2. You will be presented with patch installation prompt: Specify MOO2 and
   DOSBox locations and press Install (On Mac you need to locate and specify
   path to "Boxer Standalone" binary instead of DOSBox). For Steam and GOG
   distros, Launcher should be able to detect all locations automatically.

3. After reporting success the Launcher will switch to normal mode, where you
   can run the game. Press Launch! and check the version number in the bottom
   right corner on the Title screen to confirm that you are running 1.50.

If Launcher does not work on your system you can install manually, see
MOO2.1.50.x/README_150.TXT for details.
