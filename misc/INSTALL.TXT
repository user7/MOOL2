MOO2 Launcher is a program that can install, configure and run MOO2
1.50 patch. You need a working copy of MOO2 1.31+ to install it.

Installation:

1. Unzip package contents to any directory. On MS Windows double click
   on "MOO2 Launcher.exe". On Linux run terminal, cd to package and
   run ./moo2-launcher. In both cases you will be prompted to install
   the patch.

2. Choose one of the auto-detected locations (if you have Steam or GOG
   MOO2 installed) or enter paths manually, press Install.

3. Launcher will switch to normal mode. Select preferred mods and game
   options and click "Launch!" to run the game. On each successive run
   Launcher will go directly to normal mode. You can use desktop
   shortcut created during installation to run it.

Launcher wasn't tested on any Apple OS but Linux instructions might
work for Mac OS X, so try it. If Launcher does not work on your system
you can install manually, see MOO2.1.50.x/README_150.TXT for details.
