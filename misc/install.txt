                               MOO2 PATCH 1.50.x                               
                              ===================

PREAMBLE:
--------
The installation package contains the MOO2 patch 1.50.x with MOO2 Launcher. The
patch is an unofficial fan patch and is not supported by a company or anyone at
all. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. Installation of the patch does not break your
current MOO2 installation. No original files are overwritten. To run your old
version (e.g. GOG or Steam), use your old shortcut and to run 1.50 use the MOO2
Launcher shortcut created during installation.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
- A working copy of MOO2 DOS version 1.31 or higher.
- The game directory should contain ALL game files (full installation).
- English, French, German, Italian and Spanish languages are supported.

INSTALLATION:
-------------
1. Unzip installation package anywhere OUTSIDE of your MOO2 game directory.

2. a. Windows: run install-win32.exe.
   b. Linux: open a terminal inside unzipped directory and run ./install-linux.
   c. Mac OS X: right click install-macosx and choose open.

3. You will be presented with a patch installation prompt, which should auto-
   detect GOG and Steam distros. If there was no auto-detection, then on
   a. Windows and Linux: Specify MOO2 game directory and DOSBox locations.
   b. Mac OS X: Specify locations of MOO2 game directory and "Boxer Standalone"
      binary instead of DOSBox.

4. Press Install.

5. After reporting success MOO2 Launcher will switch to normal mode, from where
   you can run the game. Choose a mod & map, then Press Launch! to play.
