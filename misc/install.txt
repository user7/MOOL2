                              ===================

This is an unofficial fan patch, it is not supported by a company or anyone at
all. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. Installation of the patch does not break your
current MOO2 installation. No original files are overwritten. To run your old
version (e.g. GOG or Steam), use your old shortcut and to run 1.50 use the MOO2
Launcher shortcut created during installation.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
- A working copy of MOO2 DOS version 1.31 or higher.
- The MOO2 game directory should contain ALL game files (full installation).
- English, French, German, Italian and Spanish languages are supported.

INSTALLATION:
-------------
1. Unzip the installation package anywhere OUTSIDE of your MOO2 game directory.

2. a. Windows: run install-win32.exe.
   b. Linux: run ./install-linux in terminal inside unzipped directory * **.
   c. Mac OS X: right click install-macosx and choose open.

3. You will be presented with a patch installation prompt, which should auto-
   detect GOG and Steam distros. If there was no auto-detection, then specify
   path to MOO2 game directory and path to emulator:
   a. "DOSBox.exe" on Windows
   b. "dosbox" on Linux
   c. "Boxer Standalone" or "dosbox" on Mac OS X

4. Press Install.
