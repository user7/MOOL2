This package contains MOO2 patch 1.50 with MOO2 Launcher. A working copy of
MOO2 DOS version 1.31 or higher is required to install it. English, French,
German, Italian and Spanish languages are supported.

Installation of the patch does not break your current MOO2 installation. No
original files are overwritten. To run your old version (e.g. GOG or Steam),
use your old shortcut and to run 1.50 use the MOO2 Launcher shortcut created
during installation.

This an unofficial fan patch, it is not supported by a company or anyone at
all, use it at your own risk.

Installation:

1. Unzip package anywhere outside the MOO2 directory and on
   a. Windows run install-win32.exe.
   b. Linux open a terminal inside unzipped directory and run ./install-linux.
   c. Mac OS X right click install-macosx and choose open.

2. You will be presented with a patch installation prompt: Specify MOO2 and
   DOSBox locations and press Install (On Mac you need to locate and specify
   path to "Boxer Standalone" binary instead of DOSBox). For GOG and Steam
   distros, MOO2 Launcher should be able to detect all locations automatically.

3. After reporting success MOO2 Launcher will switch to normal mode, from where
   you can run the game. Press Launch! and check the version number in the
   bottom right corner of MOO2's Title screen to confirm that you are running
   version 1.50.
