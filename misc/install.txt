This package contains MOO2 1.50 patch with launcher. You need a working copy of
MOO2 1.31+ to install it. This an unofficial fan patch, it is not supported by
a company or anyone at all, use it at your own risk.

Installation:

Note that installation doesn't damage your distribution, the 1.50 executable is
installed alongside the old one. To run your old version (e.g. GOG) use your
old shortcut and to run 1.50 use launcher shortcut created during installation.

1. Unzip package anywhere outside the MOO2 directory and on
   a. Windows run install-win32.exe.
   b. Linux open a terminal inside unzipped directory and run ./install-linux.
   c. Mac OS X right click install-macosx and choose open.

2. You will be presented with patch installation prompt: Specify MOO2 and
   DOSBox locations and press Install (On Mac you need to locate and specify
   path to "Boxer Standalone" binary instead of DOSBox). For Steam and GOG
   distros, Launcher should be able to detect all locations automatically.

3. After reporting success Launcher will switch to normal mode, from where you
   can run the game. Press Launch! and check the version number in the bottom
   right corner on the Title screen to confirm that you are running 1.50.
