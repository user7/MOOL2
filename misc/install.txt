                               MOO2 patch 1.50.x                               
                              ===================

Preamble:
--------
The installation package contains the MOO2 patch 1.50.x with MOO2 Launcher. The
patch is an unofficial fan patch and is not supported by a company or anyone at
all. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. Installation of the patch does not break your
current MOO2 installation. No original files are overwritten. To run your old
version (e.g. GOG or Steam), use your old shortcut and to run 1.50 use the MOO2
Launcher shortcut created during installation.

Requirements:
-------------
- A working copy of MOO2 DOS version 1.31 or higher.
- The game directory should contain ALL game files (full installation).
- English, French, German, Italian and Spanish languages are supported.

Installation:
-------------
1. Unzip package anywhere outside the MOO2 directory and on
   a. Windows: run install-win32.exe.
   b. Linux: open a terminal inside unzipped directory and run ./install-linux.
   c. Mac OS X: right click install-macosx and choose open.

2. You will be presented with a patch installation prompt: Specify MOO2 and
   DOSBox locations and press Install (On Mac you need to locate and specify
   path to "Boxer Standalone" binary instead of DOSBox). GOG and Steam distros
   should be auto-detected.

3. After reporting success MOO2 Launcher will switch to normal mode, from where
   you can run the game. Press Launch! and confirm that the version number in
   the bottom right corner of MOO2's Title screen is 1.50.x.
